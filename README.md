# Cloud-Based Post-Exploitation Framework

## Overview

The Cloud-Based Post-Exploitation Framework is a powerful tool designed for penetration testers and security professionals to maintain access, perform lateral movement, exfiltrate data, and escalate privileges within compromised cloud assets. This framework supports multiple cloud providers, allowing you to target various cloud environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. git clone <repository_url>

markdown


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown


## Usage

1. Run the main script:
2. 
python main.py

2. The framework provides the following actions:

- **Generate Custom Payload**: Enter the vulnerability type, and the framework will generate a custom payload suitable for the target cloud provider.

- **Enumerate Cloud Resources**: Discover and list cloud resources, such as instances, buckets, databases, and roles. Identify potential targets for lateral movement.

- **Establish Persistence**: Implement techniques for maintaining persistence within the compromised cloud environment.

- **Quit**: Exit the framework.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to execute your chosen actions.

## Functions

The Cloud-Based Post-Exploitation Framework includes the following functions:

- **Dynamic Payload Generation**: Create custom payloads based on the target cloud provider and specific vulnerabilities.

- **Resource Enumeration**: Enumerate cloud resources to identify potential targets for lateral movement.

- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Implement techniques for maintaining access and persistence within the compromised environment.

- **Data Encryption**: Add encryption capabilities for exfiltrated data to maintain confidentiality.

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Extend the framework to target multiple cloud providers.

- **Session Management**: Implement session management to maintain access across multiple requests or sessions.

- **Stealth and Evasion Techniques**: Integrate stealth and evasion techniques to avoid detection by security monitoring systems.

## Disclaimer

This framework is intended for educational and penetration testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test may be illegal. Use responsibly and adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations.
